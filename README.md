# Blog-website
I have created a blog website using the following modules, along with Bootstrap for a sleek and responsive user interface

1. **Express**: This module provides the core framework for building the web application, handling routes, and managing HTTP requests and responses.

2. **EJS**: EJS is used as the templating engine to dynamically generate HTML content and display it on the blog website.

3. **Body-parser**: This module is used for parsing incoming request bodies, allowing for the extraction of data from forms and HTTP requests.

4. **Mongoose**: Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool that provides an easy and flexible way to interact with the MongoDB database, allowing you to store and retrieve data for your blog.

5. **Lodash**: Lodash is a utility library that simplifies and enhances JavaScript operations, making it easier to manipulate and manage data within the blog application.

6. **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap is integrated into the website to ensure a visually appealing and responsive design. It provides a range of pre-designed components and styles to enhance the user interface and improve the overall user experience.

These modules, in conjunction with Bootstrap, work together to create a fully functional and aesthetically pleasing blog website, allowing you to manage and display your blog content with style and efficiency.
